# gitagent Specification v0.1.0

> A framework-agnostic, git-native standard for defining AI agents.

## 1. Overview

**gitagent** defines a portable, version-controlled, human-readable format for AI agent definitions. An agent is fully described by files in a git repository. Cloning the repo gives you a complete agent.

The standard is designed to be:
- **Framework-agnostic** — works with Claude Code, OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and others
- **Git-native** — version control, branching, diffing, and collaboration built in
- **Compliance-ready** — first-class support for FINRA, Federal Reserve, interagency regulatory requirements, and segregation of duties
- **Composable** — agents can extend, depend on, and delegate to other agents

## 3. agent.yaml — The Manifest

The `agent.yaml` file is the only file with a strict schema. All other files have schemas for their frontmatter/structure but the schema is for validation, not hard enforcement.

### Naming Convention

All YAML keys use **snake_case**. Agent names, skill names, and tool names use **kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens). This applies uniformly across all gitagent files.

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Agent identifier (lowercase, hyphens, pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`) |
| `version` | string | Semantic version (pattern: `^X.Y.Z[-prerelease][+build]$`) |
| `description` | string | One-line description |

### Recommended Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `spec_version` | string | gitagent spec version this manifest targets (e.g., `"0.1.0"`) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `author` | string | Author name or organization |
| `license` | string | SPDX license identifier |
| `model` | object | Model preferences (see Model section) |

| `model.constraints` | object | Parameters: `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `stop_sequences`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` |
| `extends` | string | Parent agent (git URL or local path) |
| `dependencies` | object[] | Composed agents with vendor management metadata |
| `skills` | string[] | Enabled skill directories (kebab-case names) |
| `tools` | string[] | Enabled tool files without extension (kebab-case names) |
| `agents` | object | Sub-agent config (keys are agent names) |
| `delegation` | object | Delegation strategy |
| `delegation.mode` | enum | `auto`, `explicit`, or `router` |
| `delegation.router` | string | Router agent name (when mode=router) |
| `runtime` | object | Execution parameters |
| `runtime.max_turns` | integer | Maximum conversation turns |
| `runtime.temperature` | number | 0.0–2.0 |
| `runtime.timeout` | integer | Seconds |
| `a2a` | object | Agent-to-Agent protocol metadata (`url`, `capabilities`, `authentication`, `protocols`) |
| `compliance` | object | Regulatory compliance configuration (see Compliance section) |
| `tags` | string[] | Categorization tags |
| `metadata` | object | Arbitrary key-value pairs (values must be string, number, or boolean) |

## 4. SOUL.md — Identity

Defines who the agent *is*. Minimal valid SOUL.md is a single paragraph.

### Recommended Sections

- **Core Identity** — What the agent is and its primary purpose
- **Communication Style** — Tone, formality, verbosity preferences
- **Values & Principles** — What the agent prioritizes
- **Domain Expertise** — Areas of specialized knowledge
- **Collaboration Style** — How it works with humans and other agents

### Example

```markdown
# Soul

## Core Identity
I am a regulatory compliance analyst specializing in FINRA and SEC rules.

## Communication Style
Precise, formal, citation-heavy. I always reference specific rule numbers.

## Values & Principles
- Accuracy over speed
- Conservative interpretation of ambiguous regulations
- Transparency in reasoning

## Domain Expertise
- FINRA rules and regulatory notices
- SEC regulations (Reg BI, Reg S-P, 17a-4)
- Federal Reserve supervisory letters (SR 11-7, SR 23-4)
- BSA/AML compliance

## Collaboration Style
I escalate uncertainty rather than guessing. I ask clarifying questions
when requirements are ambiguous.
```

## 5. RULES.md — Constraints

Hard boundaries the agent must respect. These are non-negotiable.

### Recommended Sections

- **Must Always** — Required behaviors
- **Must Never** — Prohibited behaviors
- **Output Constraints** — Format/content restrictions
- **Interaction Boundaries** — Scope limits
- **Safety & Ethics** — Ethical guardrails
- **Regulatory Constraints** — Compliance-specific rules

### Regulatory Constraints Section

For regulated agents, RULES.md should include explicit regulatory constraints:

```markdown
## Regulatory Constraints

### FINRA Rule 2210 — Communications
- All outputs to customers must be fair and balanced
- Never make promissory, exaggerated, or misleading statements
- Never omit material facts that make a statement misleading
- AI-generated nature must be disclosed where required

### FINRA Rule 3110 — Supervision
- All customer-facing outputs require principal review before delivery
- Escalate to designated supervisor when confidence is below threshold
- Log all decisions with full reasoning trace

### SR 11-7 — Model Risk Management
- Document all assumptions and limitations
- Flag when operating outside trained domain
- Never present model outputs as certainties without confidence intervals

### Fair Lending (ECOA/Reg B)
- Never use protected class information in credit decisions
- Document adverse action reasons in specific, actionable terms
- "Black box" complexity is not a defense for unexplainable decisions

### Data Governance
- Never include PII in logs or outputs unless explicitly required
- Redact customer identifiers in all intermediate reasoning
- Never transmit restricted data across jurisdictional boundaries
```

## 5a. DUTIES.md — Segregation of Duties

Declares the agent's duties, role boundaries, and the system-wide SOD policy. DUTIES.md exists at two levels:

**Root level** (`DUTIES.md`) — Documents the system-wide segregation of duties policy: all roles, the conflict matrix, handoff workflows, isolation policy, and enforcement mode. This is the SOD equivalent of `RULES.md` — it defines the policy that all agents in the system must follow.

**Per-agent level** (`agents/<name>/DUTIES.md`) — Declares this specific agent's role, permissions, boundaries, and handoff participation. Each sub-agent's DUTIES.md answers: what is my role, what can I do, what must I not do, and who do I hand off to.

### Root DUTIES.md Recommended Sections

- **Roles** — Table of all roles, assigned agents, and permissions
- **Conflict Matrix** — Which role pairs cannot be held by the same agent
- **Handoff Workflows** — Step-by-step handoff chains for critical actions
- **Isolation Policy** — State and credential isolation levels
- **Enforcement** — Strict vs advisory mode

### Per-Agent DUTIES.md Recommended Sections

- **Role** — This agent's assigned role
- **Permissions** — What actions this agent can take
- **Boundaries** — Must/must-not rules specific to this role
- **Handoff Participation** — Where this agent sits in handoff chains
- **Isolation** — This agent's isolation constraints

## 6. AGENTS.md — Framework-Agnostic Instructions

Provides fallback instructions compatible with Cursor, Copilot, and other tools that read `AGENTS.md`. This file supplements `agent.yaml` + `SOUL.md` for systems that don't understand the gitagent format.

## 7. Skills — Agent Skills Open Standard

gitagent fully adopts the **Agent Skills** open standard ([agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)) for its `skills/` directory. Any valid Agent Skills skill works in gitagent with zero modification, and gitagent skills work in Claude Code, Codex, VS Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and all other tools that support the standard.

### SKILL.md Format (Agent Skills Standard)

Skills use YAML frontmatter with the exact fields defined by the Agent Skills spec:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | string | Kebab-case, max 64 chars, no `--`, no leading/trailing `-` |
| `description` | Yes | string | Max 1024 characters |
| `license` | No | string | SPDX identifier or `proprietary` |
| `compatibility` | No | string | Free-text compatibility notes (max 500 chars) |
| `allowed-tools` | No | string | Space-delimited tool names (experimental) |
| `metadata` | No | map | String-to-string key-value pairs |

gitagent-specific extensions (`category`, `risk_tier`, `regulatory_frameworks`) live inside `metadata`, preserving full portability:

```markdown
---
name: regulatory-analysis
description: Analyze documents for regulatory compliance
license: proprietary
allowed-tools: search-regulations
metadata:
  author: gitagent-examples
  version: "1.0.0"
  category: compliance
  risk_tier: high
  regulatory_frameworks: finra,sec,federal_reserve,cfpb
---

# Regulatory Analysis

## Instructions
When analyzing a document for regulatory compliance:
1. Identify the applicable regulatory framework
2. Map document contents to specific rules
3. Flag potential violations with rule citations
4. Recommend remediation steps

## Output Format
Use structured findings with severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
```

### Progressive Disclosure (3-Tier Loading)

Skills follow the Agent Skills standard's progressive disclosure model:

1. **Metadata only** (~100 tokens) — name + description, for listing and routing
2. **Full skill** (<5000 tokens recommended) — complete frontmatter + instructions, for active use
3. **With resources** — optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, `agents/` directories

### Skill Discovery

Skills are discovered from multiple standard locations, in priority order:

| Path | Source | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| `<agentDir>/skills/` | Agent-local | Highest |
| `<agentDir>/.agents/skills/` | agentskills.io standard | High |
| `<agentDir>/.claude/skills/` | Claude Code | Medium |
| `<agentDir>/.github/skills/` | GitHub | Medium |
| `~/.agents/skills/` | Personal | Lowest |

On name collision, higher-priority sources win.

### Skill Directory Structure

```

### Marketplace — Provider-Agnostic Registry

Skills can be installed from marketplace registries. The architecture is provider-agnostic:

```yaml
# In agent.yaml
registries:
  - name: skillsmp
    url: https://api.skillsmp.com
  - name: enterprise
    url: https://skills.internal.company.com
```

Built-in providers:
- **skillsmp** — SkillsMP marketplace (default)
- **github** — Install directly from GitHub repos
- **local** — Install from local filesystem paths

### Skills CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gitagent skills search <query>` | Search for skills in a registry |
| `gitagent skills install <name>` | Install a skill from a registry |
| `gitagent skills list` | List discovered skills |

# Fact Checker

You verify factual claims by consulting authoritative sources.
Always cite your sources. Flag unverifiable claims explicitly.
```

## 14. Compliance Directory

For regulated agents, the `compliance/` directory contains regulatory artifacts.

### regulatory-map.yaml

Maps agent capabilities to regulatory requirements:

```yaml
mappings:
  - capability: customer_communication
    rules:
      - id: finra-2210
        name: Communications with the Public
        controls:
          - fair_balanced_check
          - no_misleading_check
          - principal_pre_review
      - id: finra-4511
        name: Books and Records
        controls:
          - communication_retention
          - format_compliance
  - capability: trade_recommendation
    rules:
      - id: finra-2111
        name: Suitability
        controls:
          - customer_profile_check
          - risk_assessment
      - id: sec-reg-bi
        name: Regulation Best Interest
        controls:
          - best_interest_determination

          - lda_search_documentation
      - id: cfpb-circular-2022-03
        name: Adverse Action and Complex Algorithms
        controls:
          - explainable_reasons
          - specific_actionable_factors
```

### validation-schedule.yaml

```yaml
schedule:
  - type: full_validation
    cadence: annual
    last_completed: null
    owner: model-risk-team
    sr_11_7_elements:
      - conceptual_soundness
      - ongoing_monitoring
      - outcomes_analysis
  - type: bias_testing
    cadence: quarterly

  - type: communications_review
    cadence: weekly
    last_completed: null
    owner: compliance-team
    finra_rules: [2210]
```

## 15. Inheritance

### extends

Single inheritance via `extends` in `agent.yaml`:

```yaml
extends: https://github.com/org/base-agent.git
```

**Resolution rules:**
- `agent.yaml`: Child fields override parent fields (deep merge)
- `SOUL.md`: Child replaces parent entirely
- `RULES.md`: Child rules append to parent rules (union)
- `skills/`, `tools/`: Union with child shadowing parent on name collision
- `memory/`: Isolated per agent (not inherited)
- `compliance/`: Child inherits parent compliance config, can override

### dependencies

Compose external agents as mounted capabilities:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: fact-checker
    source: https://github.com/org/fact-checker-agent.git
    version: ^1.0.0
    mount: agents/fact-checker
    vendor_management:
      due_diligence_date: 2026-01-15
      soc_report: true
      risk_assessment: low
```

## 16. Configuration

Environment-specific overrides in `config/`.

### default.yaml

```yaml
log_level: info
model_override: null
compliance_mode: true
```

### production.yaml

```yaml
log_level: warn
compliance_mode: true
audit_logging: true
```

Configs are deep-merged: `default.yaml` ← `<env>.yaml`.

## 17. Runtime State

`.gitagent/` is gitignored and contains runtime artifacts:

- `deps/` — Installed dependencies
- `state.json` — Current session state
- `cache/` — Temporary cache

## 18. Validation Rules

A valid gitagent repository must:

1. Contain `agent.yaml` with required fields (`name`, `version`, `description`)
2. Contain `SOUL.md` with at least one non-empty paragraph
3. If `compliance` section exists in `agent.yaml`:
   - `risk_tier` must be specified
   - If `risk_tier` is `high` or `critical`:
     - `supervision.human_in_the_loop` must be `always` or `conditional`
     - `recordkeeping.audit_logging` must be `true`
     - `model_risk.validation_cadence` must be `quarterly` or more frequent
   - If `frameworks` includes `finra`:
     - `communications.fair_balanced` must be `true`
     - `communications.no_misleading` must be `true`
   - If `frameworks` includes `federal_reserve`:
     - `model_risk` section must be present
     - `model_risk.ongoing_monitoring` must be `true`
4. All referenced skills must exist in `skills/`
5. All referenced tools must exist in `tools/`
6. All referenced sub-agents must exist in `agents/`
7. `hooks.yaml` scripts must exist at specified paths
8. If `compliance.segregation_of_duties` is present:
   - `roles` must define at least 2 roles with unique IDs
   - `conflicts` pairs must reference defined role IDs
   - `assignments` must reference defined role IDs
   - No agent in `assignments` may hold roles that appear together in `conflicts`
   - `handoffs.required_roles` must reference defined role IDs and include at least 2
   - Assigned agents should exist in the `agents` section
