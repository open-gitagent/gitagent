# Federal Reserve Guidance Quick Reference

## SR 11-7 — Model Risk Management (2011)
Foundational guidance for all model risk including AI/ML. Requires:
- Clear purpose statement for each model
- Sound design, robust methodologies, data quality assessment
- Comprehensive documentation for unfamiliar parties
- Three-pillar validation: conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, outcomes analysis
- At minimum annual validation with independence from development
- Board and senior management oversight
- Model inventory maintenance

## SR 23-4 — Third-Party Risk Management (2023)
Replaced SR 13-19. Covers full lifecycle of third-party relationships:
- Planning, due diligence, contract negotiation, ongoing monitoring, termination
- Banks remain responsible regardless of outsourcing
- Must understand third-party AI vendor arrangements
- Proportional to size, complexity, and risk profile

## SR 21-8 — BSA/AML Model Risk Management (2021)
Interagency (Fed, FDIC, OCC with FinCEN/NCUA). Key points:
- SR 11-7 principles apply but no specific MRM framework required
- Allows targeted/change-based validation for quick updates
- Third-party BSA/AML models require documentation and validation

## CFPB Circular 2022-03 — Adverse Action and Complex Algorithms
- Creditors must provide accurate, specific adverse action reasons
- Model complexity is not a defense for unexplainable decisions
- "Lack of understanding of its own methods is not a cognizable defense"

## Key Federal Reserve Positions on AI (2025 Speeches)
- AI decisions must be "well controlled, numerically and legally precise, explainable, and replicable" (Gov. Barr, April 2025)
- Humans must remain "meaningfully involved in critical decisions" (Gov. Barr, Feb 2025)
- Focus on data quality; ensure AI does not "perpetuate or amplify biases" (Gov. Barr, Feb 2025)
- Model risk frameworks need updating for AI complexity (Gov. Barr, April 2025)
